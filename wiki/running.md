### Getting Up and Running
There are a number of ways to run this project on your local system. The simplest is to use Laravel's `artisan` server:
1. Go to your project's root (the `permissions_ui` directory or whatever you named it) and run:
 
    `php artisan serve`.  
    
    It should say:

    **Starting Laravel development server:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Another Laravel-friendly way to run the project with a few more sophisticated options is Larvel Valet.  You can get this here:

There are several other options as well.  You might try **Vagrant** (https://www.vagrantup.com) or **Docker** (https://www.docker.com).  Each has its advantages.
