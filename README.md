![](wiki/user_roles_screenshot.png)

### Introduction
The **Permissions UI** project shows an approach to creating a User Interface (UI) for the **Spatie Laravel-permission** package.  You can find that marvelous package here:

https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v3/introduction

**Permissions UI** was created with Laravel Version 8.x and includes the following packages:
- Laravel Breeze (https://github.com/laravel/breeze)
- Laravel Passport (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/passport)
- Laravel Collective Forms & HTML (https://laravelcollective.com/docs/6.x/html)

It uses [Larvel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mix) to compile the Javascript and CSS assets. The CSS framework used in the Blade templates is [Tailwind](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mix), which is bundled with Larvel Breeze.

### Requirements
- **Permissions UI** was built on **PHP version 7.4**.  If you use an earlier version, such things as property type hinting will not be supported.
- **Composer version 2.0.6** or higher.
- **npm version** 6.14.11 or higher.
